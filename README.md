# Interpretation of a Spatial omics dataset

## Overview
Welcome to our replication study repository for the class [Single Cell and Spatial Omics](https://unitn.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2023/95642/2016/9999/10616?annoOrdinamento=2016). 

This project aims to replicate and extend the findings of the study ["Spatiotemporal dynamics of macrophage heterogeneity and a potential function of Trem2hi macrophages in infarcted hearts"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32284-2) conducted by Jung, S. H., Hwang, B. H., Shin, S., Park, E. H., Park, S. H., Kim, C. W., ... & Chung, Y. J. (2022). 

In this study, we investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of immune cells following myocardial infarction (MI) using spatial transcriptomics (ST-seq) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in a mouse model.

## About the Study
The original study provides insights into the composition and temporal changes of immune cell populations post-MI, with a particular focus on the role of the Trem2 signalling pathway in macrophages. Advanced techniques such as spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq were utilized to analyze immune cell populations and gene expression profiles at different time points post-MI.

## Replication Goals
Our replication study aims to:
- Reproduce the spatial and temporal dynamics of immune cell populations post-MI as reported in the original study.
- Validate the upregulation of Trem2 expression in macrophages during the late phase post-MI.
- Assess the therapeutic potential of targeting the Trem2 signalling pathway in infarcted hearts.
